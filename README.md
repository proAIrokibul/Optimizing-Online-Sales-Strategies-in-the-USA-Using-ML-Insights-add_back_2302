## Results

      | Model                   | | Accuracy (%) |
      |-------------------------|-------- -----------|
      | **Linear Regression**   | `0.375`            | 
      | **Random Forest**       | `0.501`            |   
      | **Gradient Boosting**   | `0.473`            |  

**Best Model:** Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the highest performance with an R² score of `X.XXX`, minimal errors, and an accuracy of `XX.XX%`, making it the most suitable model for predicting sales.
